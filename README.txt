Wyatt Reller, Sudoku Puzzle Game, 1/22/2021

To play the game. Download and Extract the .zip file. Python 3.9 or higher,
and the Pygame library are required.

This is my Sudoku Puzzle Game. I made it using Python's pygame library. All of
the .PNG files were made by me. This project took me about 20 ish hours to 
complete. Probably more hours than it should have, but trying to (correctly) 
iterate over lists of lists at midnight is taxing on the brain.

I've included a puzzle in the 'Puzzles' folder, called test, along with it's 
solution. To include a different puzzle, follow the formate of that file.

To select and write notes on a square, click on the square once. A yellow
box should be drawn inside the square you've selected. Use the number keys
or the num pad to enter a note. To remove that note, press the number key
again. With the square selected, press BACKSLASH to remove all the notes. 

To enter a number into the puzzle as an answer, click the square twice,
or once, if it was already selected. A red box should then be drawn into the 
square you've chosen. Now press the number key you want to enter. To change
the number, simply press another number while the square is chosen, or
press BACKSLASH to remove it. Note that entering a number removes the notes
as well.

To deselect a square that you have clicked on, simply press ESCAPE, 
or click the right mouse button.

Once you've filled out the puzzle, click on the "Check Answer" button in 
the top right of the window. The timer in the bottom left of the window 
will stop and you can see how long it took you to finish the puzzle.

- A random puzzle generator with varying difficulty.
